        "server side request forgery. SSRF is a\n",
        "security flaw that occurs when an\n",
        "attacker manipulates a web application\n",
        "or API to request internal resources.\n",
        "These internal resources could include\n",
        "sensitive data, private systems, or even\n",

        "potentially gain unauthorized access,\n",
        "expose sensitive data, compromise\n",
        "systems, and even execute malicious code\n",
        "remotely. Now that we know what SSRF is,\n",
        "let's dive into how this vulnerability\n",
        "works. Imagine a web application that\n",
        "allows users to import data from a URL,\n",
        "publish data to a URL or fetch data from\n",
        "a remote resource. But what if the\n",

        "the user provided URLs? So the\n",
        "application becomes vulnerable to an\n",
        "SSRF attack. So here's how it works. The\n",
        "attacker finds an input field, form or\n",
        "parameter in the application where they\n",
        "can specify a URL and instead of\n",
        "providing a legitimate URL, the attacker\n",
        "craft a malicious one. So this URL could\n",
        "point to internal systems, private APIs\n",
        "or even metadata services in cloud\n",
        "environments. For example, a common\n",
        "target is the metadata service in cloud\n",
        "servers which can be accessed via this.\n",
        "Then these services often store\n",
        "sensitive information such as\n",
        "configuration details or authentication\n",
        "keys. The server trusting the user's\n",
        "input process this malicious URL and it\n",
        "makes a serverside request to a\n",

        "this manipulation an attacker can access\n",

        "systems and cloud environments. So now\n",
        "that we have explored the impact of SSRF\n",
        "attacks let's see their different types.\n",
        "Understanding these categories will help\n",
        "you grab the various ways attackers\n",
        "exploit this vulnerability. So here are\n",
        "the types of SSRF attacks. SSRF can\n",
        "manifest in different ways depending on\n",
        "what the attackers is targeting. So we\n",
        "will explore three primary types. First\n",
        "attacks targeting the server itself.\n",
        "Next cross-sight port attacks. And\n",
        "finally metadata exploitation in AWS,\n",
        "Azure and Oracle cloud environments.\n",
        "First we will talk about SSRF attacks\n",
        "where the server itself becomes the\n",
        "target. So accessing restricted URLs. So\n",
        "imagine a web application that lets user\n",
        "load content from a URL. Now if there is\n",
        "no proper validation, an attacker could\n",
        "change the URL to something internal\n",
        "like this. Okay. So this could expose\n",
        "sensitive data or admin panels. Next,\n",
        "reading files on the server. So\n",
        "sometimes attackers use SSRF to access\n",
        "local files on the server. For example,\n",
        "they could craft a request to something\n",
        "like this. This might give them a list\n",
        "of system users, which is a valuable\n",
        "first step in hacking. Then using\n",
        "uncommon protocols, SSRF can also abuse\n",
        "less common protocols like FTP or\n",
        "Gopher. For example, an attacker could\n",
        "send emails or interact with internal\n",
        "APIs using payloads like this.\n",
        "Next, let's examine cross-sight port\n",
        "attacks or XSPA. So, in this type of\n",
        "attack, SSRF scans open ports or\n",
        "services inside a network. So, first we\n",
        "have scanning ports. An attacker could\n",
        "make the server check if the ports are\n",
        "open on the network such as this. Next,\n",
        "we have probing private IPs. They might\n",
        "even scan private IP range like this\n",
        "here as you can see on the screen. So\n",
        "this helps them map out the network and\n",
        "find services to target. Finally, we\n",
        "have exploitations of cloud metadata\n",
        "endpoints. This endpoint stores\n",
        "sensitive information like access keys,\n",
        "configurations, and instance details.\n",
        "Now let's see how this works for AWS\n",
        "cloud. In AWS, there's a special\n",
        "endpoint that stores metadata. It's\n",
        "always available at this. So if\n",
        "attackers exploit SSRF to hit this\n",
        "endpoint, they can extract instance\n",
        "details like the server's host name or\n",
        "IP address. Also, AM role credentials\n",
        "which can look like this. So with this\n",
        "credentials, attackers might access AWS\n",
        "services or steal data. Now that we have\n",
        "exploit different types of SSRF attacks,\n",
        "let's take it a step further and examine\n",
        "blind SSRF vulnerability, which is a bit\n",
        "more challenging but equally\n",
        "fascinating. So now we will explore\n",
        "blind SSRF and its potential impact and\n",
        "how attackers find and exploit this\n",
        "vulnerabilities. Plus we will talk about\n",
        "some advanced techniques used to elevate\n",
        "blind SSRF attacks. So let's get into\n",
        "it. So first what is blind SSRF? Blind\n",
        "SSRF occurs when a server processes a\n",
        "backend HTTP request based on an\n",
        "attacker's URL, but the response isn't\n",
        "visible to the attackers in the front\n",
        "end. So, you can make the server send\n",
        "requests to other systems, but can't\n",
        "directly see the result. Now, let's talk\n",
        "about the impact. At the first glance,\n",
        "the impact of blind SSRF might seem\n",
        "lower compared to regular SSRF because\n",
        "you can't directly retrieve sensitive\n",
        "data. However, it's still dangerous\n",
        "because attackers can probe internal\n",
        "systems or hidden applications and they\n",
        "might uncover vulnerabilities like shell\n",
        "shock or exploit servers that haven't\n",
        "been patched. And in external cases,\n",
        "they could even achieve remote code\n",
        "execution, gaining complete control over\n",
        "the server. While it's not always as\n",
        "direct, blind SSRF still poses a serious\n",
        "risk. So, now comes the interesting\n",
        "part. How to find and exploit blind SSRF\n",
        "vulnerabilities. So first is using out\n",
        "of brand techniques. The most effective\n",
        "way to detect blind SSRF is by using out\n",
        "of brand techniques also known as OAD.\n",
        "And here's how it works. You can create\n",
        "unique domain name that point to a\n",
        "system you control. Next send these\n",
        "domain names in your payloads to the\n",
        "vulnerable application. And if the\n",
        "application is vulnerable, it will make\n",
        "an HTTP request to your domain and you\n",
        "will detect that interaction. So this\n",
        "way, even though the server's response\n",
        "isn't visible to you, you can confirm\n",

        "Preventing SSRF attacks require a\n",
        "multi-layered approach since attackers\n",
        "can use creative ways to bypass simple\n",
        "defenses. And here are some of the best\n",
        "practices to mitigate SSRF risk. First,\n",
        "we have avoid blacklist and use white\n",
        "list instead. So, blacklist rely on\n",
        "blocking specific inputs, but attackers\n",
        "can easily bypass them using wildcard\n",
        "DNS services, HTTP redirects or\n",
        "alternate IP encodings. While whitelist\n",
        "only allows access to trusted IP\n",
        "addresses or DNS names that the\n",
        "application needs. So this limits the\n",
        "scope of potentially malicious request.\n",
        "Next preventing attack is validate and\n",
        "sanitize user input. So ensure that the\n",
        "user provided URLs are thoroughly\n",
        "validated. Also reject requests to\n",
        "private IP addresses or disallowed\n",
        "domains. The next way to prevent attack\n",
        "is by handling server responses\n",
        "carefully. Never forward raw response\n",
        "bodies received from server initiated\n",
        "requests directly to the client.\n",
        "Instead, filter the responses and only\n",
        "rely expected data to prevent leaking\n",
        "sensitive server information to\n",
        "attackers. Next, restrict URL schemas.\n",
        "Allow only the necessary URL scheas such\n",
        "as HTTP and HTTPS.\n",
        "Then unused schemas like file, gopher or\n",
        "dictionary to block attackers from\n",
        "exploiting these\n",
        "protocols. Next, secure internal\n",
        "services. Many internal services for\n",
        "example radius, MongoDB or elastic\n",
        "research don't require authentication by\n",
        "default. Enforce authentication for all\n",
        "services even those operating within\n",
        "local networks. Next, monitor and log\n",
        "request. Implement logging for outgoing\n",
