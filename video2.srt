1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,120
Okay, I will destroy humans.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,439
This video sums up the perception of artificial intelligence for most of us, but it present

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,559
where there is no risk of being destroyed by machines.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,400
However, the tech tycoon Elon Musk begs to differ.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,120
He quotes that AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,960
Now whether artificial intelligence is a threat or not is debatable.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,399
Let me know your thoughts in the comments section.

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,160
For now, let me introduce you to artificial intelligence.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,700
The term artificial intelligence was first coined decades ago in the year 1956 by John

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,880
McCarty at the dot-mouth conference.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,140
He defined artificial intelligence as the science and engineering of making intelligent

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,380
machines.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,060
In a sense, AI is a technique of getting machines to work and behave like humans.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,719
In the recent past, AI has been able to accomplish this by creating machines and robots that

15
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,060
have been used in a wide range of fields including health care, robotics, marketing, business

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,099
analytics and many more.

17
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:21,780
However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI because we often tend to think of artificial

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,340
intelligence as robots doing our daily course.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,460
But the truth is, artificial intelligence has found its way into our daily lives.

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,820
It has become so generous that we don't realize we use it all the time.

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,500
For instance, have you ever wondered how Google is able to give you such accurate search results?

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,620
Or how your Facebook feed always gives you content based on your interest?

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,020
The answer to these questions is artificial intelligence.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,580
Now before I go any further, let me clear a very common misconception.

25
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:59,679
People often tend to think that artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning

26
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,920
are the same since they have common applications.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,259
For example, Siri is an application of AI, machine learning and deep learning.

28
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,259
So how are these technologies related?

29
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:17,060
Artificial intelligence is the science of getting machines to mimic the behavior of humans.

30
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,180
Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on getting machines to make decisions by feeding

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,340
them data.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,300
On the other hand, deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses the concept of

33
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,659
neural networks to solve complex problems.

34
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:38,900
So to sum it up, artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are interconnected

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,379
fields.

36
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,659
Machine learning and deep learning aids artificial intelligence by providing a set of algorithms

37
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,260
and neural networks to solve data-driven problems.

38
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,179
However, AI is not restricted to only machine learning and deep learning.

39
00:02:54,179 --> 00:03:00,019
It covers a vast domain of fields including natural language processing, object detection,

40
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,979
computer vision, robotics, expert systems and so on.

41
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:08,659
Now artificial intelligence can be structured along three evolutionary stages.

42
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,579
Or you can say that there are three different types of artificial intelligence.

43
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:18,379
First, we have the artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence and finally

44
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,460
artificial super intelligence.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,579
Artificial narrow intelligence, which is also known as weak AI, involves applying artificial

46
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,180
intelligence or need to specific task.

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,859
Now many currently existing systems that claim to use artificial intelligence are operating

48
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,859
as a weak AI focused on a narrowly defined specific problem.

49
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,379
Now Alexa is a very good example of narrow intelligence.

50
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,579
It operates within a limited predefined range of functions.

51
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,700
There is no genuine intelligence or no self-awareness despite being a sophisticated example of weak

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,780
AI.

53
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,180
Other examples of weak AI include the face verification that you see in your iPhone,

54
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,300
the autopilot feature at Tesla, the social humanoid Sophia which is built at Hansen robotics

55
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,580
and finally we have Google Maps.

56
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,740
All of these applications are based on weak AI or artificial narrow intelligence.

57
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,180
Now let's take a look at artificial general intelligence.

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,420
Artificial general intelligence is also known as strong AI.

59
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,780
It involves machines that possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human

60
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,980
being can.

61
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,259
You see machines don't possess human like abilities.

62
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:38,139
They have a strong processing unit that can perform high level computations but they're

63
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,980
not yet capable of thinking and reasoning like a human.

64
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,340
There are many experts who doubt that artificial general intelligence will ever be possible.

65
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,020
And there are also many who question whether it should be desirable.

66
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,860
I'm sure all of you have heard of Stephen Hawking's.

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,980
Now he warned us that strong AI would take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing

68
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,980
rate.

69
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,819
Humans who are limited by slow biological evolution couldn't compete and would be superseded.

70
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,659
According to artificial super intelligence this is a term that refers to the time when

71
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:18,259
the capabilities of computers will surpass human beings.

72
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,579
Artificial super intelligence is presently seen as a hypothetical situation as depicted

73
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,339
in movies and science fiction books where machines will take over the world.

74
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:34,259
However tech masterminds like Elon Musk believe that artificial super intelligence will

75
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,939
take over the world by the year 2040.

76
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,579
Now that you know the different types of artificial intelligence let's take a look at how

77
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:45,180
AI is used in the real world.

78
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,819
From spotting an 8th planet solar system which is 2500 light years away to composing

79
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:58,420
planets and poems the applications of AI have covered all possible domains in the market.

80
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:05,100
In the finance sector JP Morgan's Chase contract intelligent platform uses artificial intelligence

81
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,140
machine learning and image recognition software to analyze legal documents and extract important

82
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,939
data points and clauses in a matter of seconds.

83
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:22,580
Now manually reviewing 12,000 agreements takes over 36,000 hours but AI was able to do this

84
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,700
in a matter of seconds.

85
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,500
Coming to healthcare IBM is one of the pioneers that has developed AI software specifically

86
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,020
for medicine.

87
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:38,659
Over the 230 healthcare organizations worldwide use IBM Watson technology.

88
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:46,779
In 2016 IBM Watson AI technology was able to cross reference 20 million oncology records

89
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:51,419
and correctly diagnose a rare leukemia condition in a patient.

90
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:57,979
Coming to the next application Google's AII doctor is another initiator taken by Google

91
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,420
where they are working with an Indian IKEA chain to develop a AI system which can examine

92
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,660
retina scans and identify a condition called a diabetic retino pathi which causes blindness.

93
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,300
Coming to social media platforms like Facebook artificial intelligence is used for face verification

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,540
wherein machine learning and deep learning concepts are used to detect facial features and

95
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,939
tag your friends.

96
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,699
Another such example is Twitter's AI which is being used to identify hate speech and

97
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,139
terroristic languages in tweets.

98
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,339
It makes use of machine learning deep learning and natural language processing to filter out

99
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,019
offensive content.

100
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:46,259
The company discovered and banned 300,000 terrorist linked accounts 95% of which were found

101
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,220
by non human artificially intelligent machines.

102
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,900
The Google predictive search is one of the most famous AI applications.

103
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,220
When you begin typing a search term and Google makes recommendations for you to choose from,

104
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,380
that is AI in action.

105
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,540
Predictive searches are based on data that Google collects about you such as your location,

106
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,140
your age and other personal details.

107
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,500
By using AI the search engine attempts to guess what you might be trying to find.

108
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,740
Next we have virtual assistants.

109
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,819
Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana are examples of artificial intelligence.

110
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,699
A newly released Google's virtual assistant called Google Duplex has astonished millions

111
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,699
of people.

112
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,700
Not any can it respond to calls and book appointments for you.

113
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,500
It adds a human touch.

114
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,860
Now listen to the clip and try to distinguish between the AI and the human.

115
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Hi, I'd like to reserve a table for Wednesday the 7th.

116
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
For 7 people?

117
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
It's for 4 people.

118
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
4 people, when?

119
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,500
On Wednesday at 6pm.

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Actually we live here for like, up to like 5 people.

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,299
4 people you can come.

122
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:14,379
So which one do you think is the virtual assistant?

123
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,379
Let me know your answer in the comments.

124
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,299
Now another famous application of artificial intelligence is self-driving cars.

125
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:27,379
AI implements computer vision, image detection and deep learning to build cars that can automatically

126
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:31,139
detect objects and drive around without human intervention.

127
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:37,220
Elon Musk talks a ton about how AI is implemented in Tesla's self-driving cars and autopilot

128
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
features.

129
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,980
He quoted that Tesla will have fully self-driving cars ready by the end of the year and a

130
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,019
robot taxi version, one that can ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel.

131
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,180
So I can go on and on about the various AI applications.

132
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,980
Since the emergence of AI in 1950s, we have seen an exponential growth in its potential.

133
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,580
AI covers domains such as machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, natural language

134
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,139
processing, knowledge base, expert systems and so on.

135
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,460
It has also made its way into computer vision and image processing.

136
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,899
As AI is branching out into every aspect of our lives, is it possible that one day AI

137
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,939
might take over our lives and if it is possible how long will this take?

138
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,259
Well it may be sooner than you think.

139
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,259
It is estimated that AI will take over the world within the next 30 years.

140
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:39,500
By then I hope we develop some sort of teleportation machine that helps us escape our very own

141
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
creation.

142
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,860
Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

143
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,500
So that's all from my side.

144
00:10:44,500 --> 00:11:03,899
Until next time, happy learning.
