1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,599
In today's world, people are more dependent on technology than ever before.

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,500
From waking up to annoying smartphone alarms, to strolling through their social media accounts

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,839
and even controlling devices around them, technology is everywhere.

4
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,080
With so much technology coming in, the risk of cyber attacks has increased.

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,079
It's really important to understand and implement cybersecurity measures to protect our valuable information

6
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,679
and ensure that our data remains safe.

7
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,479
Hi, I welcome you all to this session on Cybersecurity for beginners by Adureka.

This will have everything you need to know to get started with Cybersecurity.

9
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,280
But before we begin, let's look at our today's agenda.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,679
First we have what is Cybersecurity.

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,480
Here we will discuss the definition and the scope of Cybersecurity.

12
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:59,479
We will also discuss the basic concepts such as the CIA triad, authorization, authentication and non-depudiation.

13
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,879
Then we will move on to the origin of Cybersecurity part.

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,879
There we will discuss the historical background and evolution of Cybersecurity.

15
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,479
We will also discuss the key milestones and events that shape this field.

16
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,479
Next we will talk about the necessity of Cybersecurity.

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,479
Here we will discuss the reasons why Cybersecurity is essential.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Also we will talk about some examples of real-world incidents and consequences of Cyberattacks.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Next we will move on to what the Cybersecurity involves.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,880
Here we will talk about the core principles and objectives of Cybersecurity.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,080
We will also talk about the different domains within Cybersecurity, like network security, application security and so.

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,880
Next we will talk about different types of Cybersecurity threats.

23
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,879
Here we will talk about the various types of Cybertrids such as malware, phishing, ransomware and so on.

24
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,879
Next we can talk about ethical hacking and penetration testing.

25
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,079
Here we will discuss the role of ethical hackers, like the White Hat hackers.

26
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,679
And we will also talk about the benefits of proactive testing and vulnerability assessments.

27
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,879
Next we will find out this video by talking about strategies to enhance Cybersecurity.

28
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,879
Here we will discuss the best practices for individuals and organizations to enhance their Cybersecurity.

29
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:24,879
But before we begin with our discussion, please consider subscribing to our YouTube channel and hit the bell icon to stay updated on the latest content from EduReka.

30
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,879
Also visit the EduReka website for various Cybersecurity training and certification courses.

31
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,879
The link to which is in the description box below.

32
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,879
Now let's start with our first topic, what is Cybersecurity?

33
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,879
Cybersecurity is a combination of two words, cyber and security.

34
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,879
The word cyber refers to computers, networks and programs and security as you all know means protection.

35
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,879
Now this gives us the definition of cybersecurity.

36
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:02,879
Cybersecurity is a practice of protecting computer systems, networks, electronic devices and programs from cyber attacks that intend to access,

37
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,879
either or destroy sensitive user information and disrupt business operations.

38
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:16,879
Now cybersecurity covers various domains including network security, application security, information security and operation security.

39
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,879
Now let's explore the key ideas that form the core of cybersecurity.

40
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,879
These concepts help us keep our distal world safe and secure.

41
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,879
At first we have the CIA tried.

42
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,879
The CIA tried means confidentiality, integrity and availability.

43
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,879
Let's talk about confidentiality first.

44
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,879
It means making sure only the right people can see the information.

45
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,879
For example, it's like having a password to protect our email.

46
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,879
Next we have integrity.

47
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,879
It says making sure the information is correct and hasn't been changed.

48
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,879
For example, this is like checking if a file has been edited without your permission.

49
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,879
Next we have availability.

50
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,879
It says making sure the information is there when you need it.

51
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,879
For example, this is like a website that is always working so that you can use it anytime.

52
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,879
Next we will be talking about authorization, authentication and non-dapudiation.

53
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,879
Let's start with authorization first.

54
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,879
It says dividing what someone can do.

55
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,879
For example, this is like being able to read a document but you cannot edit it.

56
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,879
Next we have authentication.

57
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,879
It says proving who someone is.

58
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,879
For example, this is like entering your username and password to log in into our website.

59
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,879
Next we have non-dapudiation.

60
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,879
It says making sure someone cannot say that they didn't do something.

61
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,879
For example, it's like sending an email with a special code that proves that you have sent it.

62
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,879
So you cannot deny it later.

63
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,879
Now let's move on to our next topic.

64
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,879
The origin of cybersecurity.

65
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:00,879
The history of cybersecurity began in 1971 when Bob Thomas developed a virus called Creeper.

66
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:07,879
Creeper was basically a non-malicious piece of code that moved between computers displaying the message

67
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,879
I am the creeper catch me if you can.

68
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,879
Now in response to this, Ray Thompson came up with the antivirus program known as Reaper.

69
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,879
Reaper could locate creeper and utilize its copies from the infected system.

70
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,879
Now this marked an early attempt at successfully creating an antivirus software and was the first historical movement

71
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,879
when people realized the need of cybersecurity.

72
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,879
Let's move on to our next topic.

73
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,879
Necessity of cybersecurity.

74
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:41,879
Now that happened in 1971, but in today's digital age, the necessity of cybersecurity has increased,

75
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,879
as people are more reliant on technology for their day-to-day needs.

76
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:53,879
Now, cybersecurity is essential because it protects our valuable data and computer systems from malicious attack that happened daily.

77
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:02,879
Without proper security measures, sensitive information such as personal details, financial data and private communications can be exposed to hackers.

78
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,879
Let's talk about some real-world examples that showed that how damaging cyber attacks can be.

79
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,879
Let's start with the one I cry ransomware attack first.

80
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,879
This attack took advantage of a weakness in Windows known as Eternal Blue.

81
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,879
This weakness had been leaked by a hacker group a month earlier.

82
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,879
Microsoft had already released a security update to fix this problem, but many users had not installed it.

83
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,879
This attack affected 230,000 computers in over 150 countries.

84
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,879
Next, we have the 2014 Yahoo Attack.

85
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,879
Yahoo experienced one of the biggest data breaches ever when about 500 million accounts were hacked.

86
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:52,879
Hackers got into Yahoo system and stole information such as names, emails, addresses, bird dates, phone numbers and even security questions and answers.

87
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,879
Next, we have the Adobe Cyber Attack.

88
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:02,879
Over 38 million customer accounts were hacked, including encrypted passwords, credit card details and email addresses.

89
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:09,879
The hackers also stole the source code for some of the Adobe populace software such as the Photoshop and Acrobat software.

90
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,879
Next, we have the PlayStation Network Attack.

91
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:20,879
Hackers broke into Sony's PlayStation Network and stole personal information from about 77 million user accounts.

92
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:28,879
Although, credit card information was protected but other sensitive information such as names, addresses, emails and bird dates were not.

93
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,879
Because of this, Sony had to shut down their PlayStation Network servers for about 23 days.

94
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,879
Moving on to our next topic, what does cybersecurity involves?

95
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:47,879
It involves the practices, technologies and measures that are designed to protect the system's networks and data from various threats and vulnerabilities.

96
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:56,879
Security updates, continuous monitoring and user awareness are effectively required to recognize potential threats like malware and phishing scams.

97
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,879
Now, talking about different domains within cyber security. At first, we have network security.

98
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,879
It means protecting the devices and data in a computer network from unauthorized access, attacks or damage.

99
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,879
Next, we have application security. It involves making sure software programs are safe from hackers.

100
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,879
Next, we have identity and access management. It is about controlling who can access what information in a system.

101
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,879
Next, we have cloud security. It is about predicting data and systems that are stored and run over the cloud servers.

102
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:39,879
Next, we have incident response. It involves identifying, managing and recovering from cyber incidents to minimize damage and prevent future attacks.

103
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:46,879
Next, we have threat intelligence. It involves gathering and analyzing information about potential cyber threats.

104
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,879
Next, and last, we have 4 and 6. It refers to investigating a cyber crime after it happened.

105
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,879
Let's move on to our next topic, cybersecurity threats.

106
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,879
Now that we understand cybersecurity, let's examine the common forms of cyber security threats.

107
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,879
But before that, let's discuss what our cyber threat is.

108
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:15,879
A cyber threat involves malicious actions intended to steal, damage or disrupt data, compromising data confidentiality, integrity and availability.

109
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:21,879
There are 2 common types of cyber threats. Malware attacks and social engineering attacks.

110
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,879
Talking about various malware attacks. The first malware we have is viruses.

111
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,879
A malware that attaches itself to the host file and spreads when the infected file is executed.

112
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,879
The next malware we are going to talk about is worms.

113
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,879
It is a malware that spreads by itself without needing to attach to other software.

114
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,879
For example, it's like a bomb that digs tunnel in your garden.

115
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,879
Damaging plants as it goes.

116
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,879
The next malware we are going to talk about is a Trojan.

117
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,879
A malware that pretends to be something useful or fun, but is harmful once opened.

118
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,879
For example, it's like a fake lizard under a Christmas tree.

119
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,879
That looks exciting, but has something scary inside.

120
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,879
Next, we have a ransomware.

121
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,879
A malware that locks your files and demands money to unlock them.

122
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,879
For example, it's like a kidnapper holding something valuable and asking some ransom.

123
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,879
Now, let's talk about some social engineering attacks.

124
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,879
Social engineering tricks people into giving away their information.

125
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,879
The first social engineering attack we are going to talk about is baiting.

126
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,879
So baiting involves taking users with some false promises like free price money or lottery

127
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,879
that actually contains some hidden malware that leads to a security breach.

128
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,879
For example, an attacker might offer a free download that actually installs some malware.

129
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,879
Next, we have phishing.

130
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,879
Fishing involves sending fake emails to a steel personal information.

131
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,879
For example, an attacker sends an email pretending to be from your bank asking for your account details.

132
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,879
Next, we have phishing.

133
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,879
A phishing that is done through voice calls.

134
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,879
For example, a scammer calling you pretending to be from a tech support and asking for your password.

135
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,879
The next attack we have is phishing.

136
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,879
A phishing done through text messages.

137
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:12,879
For example, an attacker sends in text messages with a link that leads to a fake website that steals your information.

138
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,879
Now, there are many other ways that attacker can harm your computer or steal information.

139
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,879
For example, we have denial of service attack.

140
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,879
What it does is it overloads your website and makes it unavailable.

141
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,879
Next, we have a distributed denial of service attack.

142
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,879
It uses multiple computers to launch a loss attack.

143
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,879
Next, we have man in the middle attack.

144
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,879
It intercepts communication between two parties to steal or alter your information.

145
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,879
Next, we have a SQL injection attack.

146
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,879
It injects malicious code into a database query to access or change the data.

147
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,879
Next, we have zero-day exploits.

148
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,879
It says attacking a software vulnerability that is unknown to the software maker.

149
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,879
For example, it's like finding a exploit or a secret door in a house before the owners knows it.

150
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,879
Moving on to our next topic, ethical hacking and penetration testing.

151
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:11,879
Ethical hacking and penetration testing are ways to find and fix security weakness in a computer system or network before hackers can exploit them.

152
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,879
First, we will talk about the role of an ethical hacker in cybersecurity.

153
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,879
Let's start with what they do.

154
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,879
Ethical hackers are security experts who are paid to hack into systems legally.

155
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,879
Now, why do they do it?

156
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,879
Their goal is to find security problems and fix weakness before an attacker can find them.

157
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,879
Now, how do they help?

158
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,879
By identifying and fixing these problems, ethical hackers help protect system and information from cyber attacks.

159
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,879
Next, we will discuss the role of penetration testing in cybersecurity.

160
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,879
The first role is the sync security.

161
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,879
Penetational testers try to break into a system just like real hackers would.

162
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,879
Next, they find weaknesses.

163
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,879
They look for ways to get past defenses like guessing passwords.

164
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,879
Then, it comes to fixing problems.

165
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:01,879
When they find a problem, they inform the development team to fix it so that the real hackers can't exploit them.

166
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,879
Moving on to the last topic for this video.

167
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,879
Strategies to enhance cyber security.

168
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,879
These are the strategies that normal users and organizations should use to enhance the security of their distilled assets.

169
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,879
Let's start with the normal users first.

170
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,879
First, we have this strong password management.

171
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,879
Use strong passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.

172
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,879
Avoid using the same passwords across different accounts.

173
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,879
Next, we have used two factor authentication and multi factor authentication.

174
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:36,879
Use methods like OTPs, authentication apps and fingerprint scanners in addition to the passwords so that you can add an extra layer of security.

175
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,879
Next, we have is safe internet practices.

176
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,879
Be careful when clicking on links or downloading files from unknown software.

177
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,879
Next, we have this data backup.

178
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,879
Make copies of important files so that you won't lose them if something happens with your device.

179
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,879
Next, we have is privacy settings and privacy permissions.

180
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:59,879
Check and adjust the privacy settings on your social media and apps so that you can control who can see your information.

181
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,879
Next, we have is awareness and education.

182
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,879
Learn about common tricks that scammers use so that you can avoid falling into the tricks.

183
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,879
Now, let's discuss the strategies organizations should use.

184
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,879
At first, we have strong password policy.

185
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,879
Create rules for employees to make strong passwords and update them regularly.

186
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,879
Implement multi factor authentication.

187
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,879
Make employees use more than one way to prove who they are when logging into the systems.

188
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,879
Next, we have regular software and system updates.

189
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,879
Keep everything up to date to fix problems that could let hackers in.

190
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,879
Next, we have is having a secure network firewall and intrusion detection system.

191
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,879
A strong firewall and ideas should be used to monitor the network traffic entering and leaving the company's network.

192
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,879
Next, we have is a backup and disaster recovery plan.

193
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,879
Make a plan to copy data often and practice getting it back so the companies can keep working if something goes wrong.

194
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,879
Next, we have monitoring security logs.

195
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,879
Monitor the company's computer systems to save anyone who is trying to access them without permission.

196
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,879
Now that we have covered all the topics in this video,

197
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,879
it's clear how vital cyber security is in our interconnected world.

198
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,879
The internet offers amazing opportunities but also brings some serious risks.

199
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,879
