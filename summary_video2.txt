The term artificial intelligence was first coined decades ago in the year 1956 by John McCarty at the dot-mouth conference. In a sense, AI is a technique of getting machines to work and behave like humans. People often tend to think that artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are the same since they have common applications. Now whether artificial intelligence is a threat or not is debatable. Artificial narrow intelligence, which is also known as weak AI, involves applying artificial intelligence or need to specific task. Many currently existing systems that claim to use artificial intelligence are operating as a weak AI focused on a narrowly defined specific problem. There are many experts who doubt that artificial general intelligence will ever be possible. However tech masterminds like Elon Musk believe that artificial super intelligence will take over the world by the year 2040. Google's AII doctor is another initiator taken by Google where they are working with an Indian IKEA chain to develop a AI system which can examine retina scans and identify a condition called a diabetic retino pathi which causes blindness. Twitter's AI is being used to identify hate speech and terroristic languages in tweets. Elon Musk talks a ton about how AI is implemented in Tesla's self-driving cars and autopilot features. It is estimated that AI will take over the world within the next 30 years. By then I hope we develop some sort of teleportation machine that helps us escape our very own creation.
